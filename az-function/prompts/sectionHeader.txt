## What is a Super App
### {PLACEHOLDER_HEADER}
- Statistics: We use a single app 50% of the time, 3 apps 77% of the time.
- A Super App should be a destination app that is one of those top 3 most frequently used apps.
- Have a direct relation with users, not an aggregation of apps with different relationships.
- Partnerships with other related verticals are still important to avoid building too many lines of businesses at the same time. Details of the partnerships vary, which could include: business commissions, customer fees, delivery commissions (i.e. Lazada, Shopee)
- This implies a lot of planning on the business verticals that are accessible via the Super App.

### {PLACEHOLDER_HEADER}
- There is current belief that super apps only work in Asia but not necessarily in North America and EMEA. This is partly due to:
	- A lot of Asians skipped PCs and internet and went straight to mobile devices.
	- Conglomerate structure of Asia owning multiple lines of businesses, vs. very specialized business in the US/EMEA.
	- In a month, US/EMEA average users interact with 20 apps.

### Categories: Ecosystems & Gateways
- **Ecosystems:** Social communities with payment systems. WeChat, for example, allows users to message friends, pay bills, and order taxis seamlessly in-app.
- **Gateways:** Payment platform bringing together distinct services. Paytm for example, allows you to top-up mobile phones, buy plane tickets, and book hotels using a mobile wallet integrating across different partner sites.

### {PLACEHOLDER_HEADER}
- Makes convenient and shortens the path to a user’s desired action. 
- Makes available a variety of services
- Saves phone or device memory.
- Marketplace capabilities scale as third parties join the ecosystem.
- Platform for a uniform and individualized user experience.
- Incredible volumes of customer data enable targeted advertising.
- Optimization and savings in marketing spend.
	- Reduce user (re)acquisition cost
	- Reach new customer segments (based on business verticals)
