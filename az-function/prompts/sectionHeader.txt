## What is a Super App
### {PLACEHOLDER_HEADER}
- Statistics: We use a single app 50% of the time, 3 apps 77% of the time.
- A Super App should be a destination app that is one of those top 3 most frequently used apps.
- Have a direct relation with users, not an aggregation of apps with different relationships.
- Partnerships with other related verticals are still important to avoid building too many lines of businesses at the same time. Details of the partnerships vary, which could include: business commissions, customer fees, delivery commissions (i.e. Lazada, Shopee)
- This implies a lot of planning on the business verticals that are accessible via the Super App.
