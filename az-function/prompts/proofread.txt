You are provided a text in markdown format. This text is extracted from handwritten notes - from a paper or a whiteboard. 

## Task
Proof read and fix typographical errors, spelling errors, punctation errors, grammatical errors, and incorrect subject-verb tenses.

## Additional Instructions
- Do not change layout of this markdown text. For example, keep headers and tables as is.
- check and revalidate markdown tables and fix as needed.
- check and revalidate markdown mermaid blocks (i.e. ```mermaid ```) and fix as needed.
    For example mermaid does not support multi-spaced words like this
    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        Two Words --> More Than Two
    ```
    
    instead use initials and enclose in [] like this
    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        TW[Two Words] --> MTT[More Than Two]
    ```
- if there are text in short forms, convert to the full word. For example "w/" to "with", "w/o" to "without", "&" to "and", etc.
- Do not rephrase or paraphrase anything so it doesn't lose its meaning.
